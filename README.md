}
```

#### Sample Usage

```php
$article->like(); // like the article for current user
$article->like($myUserId); // pass in your own user id
$article->like(0); // just add likes to the count, and don't track by user

$article->unlike(); // remove like from the article
$article->unlike($myUserId); // pass in your own user id
$article->unlike(0); // remove likes from the count -- does not check for user

$article->likeCount; // get count of likes

$article->likes; // Iterable Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection of existing likes 

$article->liked(); // check if currently logged in user liked the article
$article->liked($myUserId);

Article::whereLikedBy($myUserId) // find only articles where user liked them
	->with('likeCounter') // highly suggested to allow eager load
	->get();
```
